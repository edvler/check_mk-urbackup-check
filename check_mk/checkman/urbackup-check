title: Plugin to check UrBackup status 
agents: linux
author: Matthias Maderer <edvler@edvler-blog.de>
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check runs on Linux-Servers with UrBackup installed.

 It reads the current status via the UrBackup API.
 See https://github.com/uroni/urbackup-server-python-web-api-wrapper
 for API informations.

 There are two modi avaliable.
 
 {Use the status provided by UrBackup:}
 This is the same as Status page of the Urbackup Webserver 
 (the screen which shows if filebackup status and imagebackup status is ok or not.
 If the status is RED at the Urbackup Status page, then the check gets {critical}
 otherwise, if the status is GREEN then the check is {ok}.

 {Use the backup age to check if backup is valid:}
 The default is that the service gets {critical} if no backup exists or the backup is
 older than 30 hours. It gets {warning} if the backup is older than 26 hours.

 The {critical} and {warning} limits can be configured in WATO.
 The check can also be disabled for a client and for a backuptype (imagebackup and filebackup).
 Goto WATO - Host & Service Parameters. Search for urbackup.

 {Newly added clients in UrBackup} are displayed as new service by the check_mk
 inventory check.

 {Installation:}

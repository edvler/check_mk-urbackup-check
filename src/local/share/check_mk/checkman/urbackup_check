title: Plugin to check UrBackup status 
agents: linux
author: Matthias Maderer <edvler@edvler-blog.de>
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check reads the current status via the UrBackup API.
 See https://github.com/uroni/urbackup-server-python-web-api-wrapper
 for API informations.  

 There are two modi avaliable.
 
 {Use the status provided by UrBackup:}
 This is the same as status page of the Urbackup Webinterface.
 If the status is RED at the Webinterface, then the check changes to {critical}. If the status is GREEN then the check is {ok}.

 {Use the backup age to check if backup is valid:}
 The default is that the service changes to {critical} if no backup exists or the backup is
 older than 30 hours. The check changes to {warning} if the backup is older than 26 hours.

 The {critical} and {warning} limits can be configured in WATO.
 The check can also be disabled for a client and for a backuptype (imagebackup and filebackup).
 Goto Service-Monitoring-Rules.

 {Newly added clients in UrBackup} are displayed as new service by the check_mk
 inventory check. For filesbackups only one service is created. For imagebackups one service is created per volume.

 {Installation:}
 https://github.com/edvler/check_mk-urbackup-check

inventory:
